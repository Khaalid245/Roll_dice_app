### Flutter Learning Journey

### Overview
This README outlines my learning progress in Flutter and the small project I built to practice my skills.

### What I Have Learned
- **Widgets**: Understanding and implementing Stateful and Stateless widgets.
- **Layout**: Learning how to use `Column`, `Row`, `Expanded`, and `SizedBox` for UI structuring.
- **File Structure**: Organizing code into multiple files and using `import` to manage dependencies.
- **Math and Randomization**: Importing the `dart:math` package to generate random values.
- **Variables and Images**:
  - Using variables to store and manipulate data.
  - Displaying images using the `Image` widget.
- **State Management**:
  - Utilizing `setState` to update the UI dynamically.
- **Text Widget**: Displaying text in the app using the `Text` widget.

### Practice Project: Roll Dice Flutter App
After learning these concepts, I applied them by building a **Roll Dice App** in Flutter. This app allows users to roll a dice randomly by clicking a button. It demonstrates:
- Stateful widget implementation.
- Image rendering based on state changes.
- Random number generation for dice rolls.
- UI layout using `Column`, `Row`, and weight properties.


This project helped reinforce my understanding of Flutter basics and UI development.

I will continue learning and working on more projects to enhance my Flutter skills!
